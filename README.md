# Store Sales Forecasting Model

## Project Workflow
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast weekly sales for different store types. The application is built using Python and Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to input relevant features and obtain sales predictions.

## 1. Data Collection
Objective: Gather historical sales data.
Process:
Collect data including store type, department, temperature, CPI, unemployment rate, holiday status, and store size.
Ensure data is clean and properly formatted for analysis.
## 2. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Prepare the data for modeling.
Process:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., store type, holiday status).
Scale numerical features (e.g., temperature, CPI, unemployment rate).
## 3. Feature Engineering
Objective: Create meaningful features for the model.
Process:
Create new features if necessary (e.g., interaction terms).
Ensure features are relevant and contribute to model accuracy.
## 4. Model Development
Objective: Build a predictive model for sales forecasting.
Process:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Evaluate models using performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
Select the best-performing model for deployment.
## 5. Model Training
Objective: Train the final model on the entire training set.
Process:
Fine-tune model hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Validate the model to ensure robustness and accuracy.
## 6. Model Deployment
Objective: Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
Process:
Save the trained model using joblib.
Develop a Streamlit application to provide an interactive user interface.
## 7. Streamlit Application Development
Objective: Create a user-friendly web app for sales predictions.
Process:
Design the layout and interface with input fields for store type, department, temperature, etc.
Integrate the model to provide real-time sales predictions based on user inputs.
## 8. Testing and Validation
Objective: Ensure the application works correctly and provides accurate predictions.
Process:
Test the application with various inputs to validate functionality.
Perform user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make improvements.
## 9. Documentation
Objective: Provide comprehensive documentation for the project.
Process:
Write detailed README file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide.
Document the data sources, preprocessing steps, model development, and deployment process.
## 10. Deployment and Sharing
Objective: Deploy the application and share the project.
Process:
Host the Streamlit app using Streamlit Sharing or any cloud platform.
Share the GitHub repository with detailed documentation and source code.
